# COVID-19 Dashboard

This COVID-19 tracking dashboard website will pull up-to-date covid-19 information via 3rd party APIs, then present the data in a cohesive, simple dashboard. Data is segmented into a few categories: Statistical Data, Interactive map, Latest News. The app will also give users a high-level, one-line assessment of the state of covid-19 containment in their area, allowing users to make informed decisions. The webpage will be responsive & each section will tell users the timing for each piece of data.
